# Case Railways Train Scheduler

## Description

* **What is Case Railways Train Scheduler?**
The Case Railways Train Scheduler is an application styled with Bootstrap, and programmed with jQuery and JavaScript. Firebase Realtime Database is used to store the train data in the scheduler. The application is designed to present the user with data regarding train arrivals, and allow them to add additional trains to the table.

* **How Does Case Railways Train Scheduler Work?**
The app accepts user input into a form for train name, destination, start time, and frequency of arrival in minutes. It then takes that data and calculates when the next arrival will be, relative to the current time. Then, data is stored into Firebase and displayed in a table. The app will always post next arrival and minutes to arrival relative to the current time.

* **Target Audience of Case Railways Train Scheduler**
The target audience of this application is anyone interested in simple applications developed using Firebase for data persistence.

* **Purpose of the Project**
The purpose of this project was to practice Firebase concepts learned through Week 7 of the University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp.
